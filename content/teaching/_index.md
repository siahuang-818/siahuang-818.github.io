I have been taking part on several teaching activity either become teaching assistant in university or tutor in local community discussion. I found my passion on teaching early on my undergraduate years. One of them is my experience as laboratory teaching asistant on molecular biology for Tim Olimpiade Biologi Indonesia, a team of Indonesian candidate (high school students) for International Biology Olympiad competition. Below are my experiences on teaching activity during my PhD year. Besides on the listed course, I am also curently a Research Asistant in Yamada Laboratory with the responsibility to involve and teach master students to conduct a research project beside my main project.
