I am curently involve in several research projects related to explorations of gut microbiome and metabolome in gastrointestinal related diseases. My PhD project aims for **comprehensive characterizations of human fecal microbiome and metabolome after gastrectomy for gastric cancer**. In additions, I also actively involve as a research assistant for hereditary colorectal cancer project and diet-microbiome project during my PhD. My posdoctoral research project further explore the potential association of human microbiome with long-term diseases condition using the large, deeply phenotype population cohort.

## **Past Research**

I have worked on the deep-sea metagenomics study and synthetic biology during my undergraduate years. After graduations in bachelor program, I have worked in private research institute working on phytochemical effectiveness as anticancer treatment.
