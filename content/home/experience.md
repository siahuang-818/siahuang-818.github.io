  description = """During my PhD at the University of Manchester, I have focused on key topics in wireless communications, particularly non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and backscatter communication (BackCom). My research has primarily involved developing optimization techniques for enhancing the performance of NOMA systems, such as maximizing uplink data rates, improving energy efficiency, and designing effective beamforming strategies. I have also explored convex and non-convex optimization methods, including Dinkelbach and successive convex approximation approaches, to solve complex problems in resource allocation and interference management.

In addition to these topics, I have been involved in researching cognitive radio and fluid antenna systems, which are essential for next-generation wireless networks. My work aims to provide practical solutions to improve the efficiency and capacity of wireless communications."""
