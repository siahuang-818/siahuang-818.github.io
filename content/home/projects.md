  publication_name = "Cart Pole"
  publication_url = "https://github.com/siahuang-818/CartPole"
#  writer_names = "**D. Lin**, S. Al-Basit, K. Wang and Z. Ding"
  organization = "I tackled the classic CartPole problem using a reinforcement learning approach with PPO and a MLP policy. By developing and training the model, I successfully taught it to balance a pole on a moving cart. The project involved fine-tuning hyper parameters and evaluating performance to achieve optimal results. "

  publication_name = "Yolo Cat Dog"
  publication_url = "https://github.com/siahuang-818/yolo_cat-dog"
#  writer_names = "**D. Lin**, S. Al-Basit, K. Wang and Z. Ding"
  organization = "I set up the development environment using Anaconda on a Windows system and converted the original data set into a YOLO-compatible format. I experimented with various methods to validate the YOLO model's performance in detecting cats and dogs. By testing with datasets of different sizes, such as 200 and 2000 images, I analyzed the impact on detection accuracy and model robustness. I monitored performance metrics through loss rate charts and other evaluation graphs to fine-tune the model effectively."

  publication_name = "Yolo Circle"
  publication_url = "https://github.com/siahuang-818/yolo_circle"
#  writer_names = "**D. Lin**, S. Al-Basit, K. Wang and Z. Ding"
  organization = "In the \"YOLO Circle\" project, I aimed to detect and recognize circles and rectangles using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The process involved capturing images containing these shapes, annotating the dataset, and training the YOLO model. By adjusting the number of training epochs, I evaluated the model's performance and tested the boundaries of YOLO's effectiveness. Additionally, I monitored for signs of overfitting by comparing training and validation performance and applied optimization strategies like data augmentation and regularization if necessary. This project provided insights into YOLO's capabilities and limitations in simple shape detection tasks."

  publication_url = "https://github.com/siahuang-818/my-kpop-outfits"
#  writer_names = "**D. Lin**, S. Al-Basit, K. Wang and Z. Ding"
  organization = "I developed a K-pop fashion website using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly platform. By enhancing the user experience, I ensured that visitors can easily explore the latest K-pop trends and styling tips."
