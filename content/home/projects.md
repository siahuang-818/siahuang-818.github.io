  publication_name = "Cart Pole"
  publication_url = "https://github.com/siahuang-818/CartPole"
#  writer_names = "**D. Lin**, S. Al-Basit, K. Wang and Z. Ding"
  organization = "The project tackled the classic CartPole problem using a reinforcement learning approach with PPO and an MLP policy. By developing and training the model, it successfully taught the system to balance a pole on a moving cart. The project involved fine-tuning hyperparameters and evaluating performance to achieve optimal results. "

  publication_name = "Yolo Cat Dog"
  publication_url = "https://github.com/siahuang-818/yolo_cat-dog"
#  writer_names = "**D. Lin**, S. Al-Basit, K. Wang and Z. Ding"
  organization = "The project involved setting up the development environment using Anaconda on a Windows system and converting the original dataset into a YOLO-compatible format. Various methods were experimented with to validate the YOLO model's performance in detecting cats and dogs. By testing with datasets of different sizes, such as 200 and 2000 images, the project analyzed the impact on detection accuracy and model robustness. Performance metrics were monitored through loss rate charts and other evaluation graphs to fine-tune the model effectively."

  publication_name = "Yolo Circle"
  publication_url = "https://github.com/siahuang-818/yolo_circle"
#  writer_names = "**D. Lin**, S. Al-Basit, K. Wang and Z. Ding"
  organization = "In the \"YOLO Circle\" project, the goal was to detect and recognize circles and rectangles using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The process involved capturing images with these shapes, annotating the dataset, and training the YOLO model. By adjusting the number of training epochs, the project evaluated the model's performance and tested the boundaries of YOLO's effectiveness. Additionally, signs of overfitting were monitored by comparing training and validation performance, and optimization strategies like data augmentation and regularization were applied if necessary. This project provided insights into YOLO's capabilities and limitations in simple shape detection tasks."

  publication_name = "My Kpop Outfits"
  publication_url = "https://github.com/siahuang-818/my-kpop-outfits"
#  writer_names = "**D. Lin**, S. Al-Basit, K. Wang and Z. Ding"
  organization = "The website was developed using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly platform focused on K-pop fashion. By enhancing the user experience, the website ensures that visitors can easily explore the latest K-pop trends and styling tips."

 publication_name = "Grid World"
  publication_url = "https://github.com/siahuang-818/GridWorld"
  organization = "This project enhances the classic Grid World reinforcement learning environment by introducing dynamic obstacles, increasing complexity and challenge. It serves as an ideal platform for developing advanced reinforcement learning algorithms capable of handling dynamic and uncertain environments. The project features a dynamic grid where obstacles move randomly, requiring agents to make complex decisions and learn to navigate effectively. The reward system encourages agents to reach the goal quickly while avoiding penalties from obstacles and boundary breaches. This setup is perfect for testing various algorithms, particularly those suited for dynamic settings, with potential applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and dynamic path planning. "
